    <h1>This is a basic app to create a shopping list</h1>

    <p> The app's framework was made using Codeigniter 4. I've only had experience with codeIgniter 3.
        <br>
        A lot of things went wrong because of this, there's more security, such as ajax requests being blocked on default javascript. and from CDN jquery.
        <br>
        A CSRF is required to make them.  Other than that, the server is host on AWS ec2. The database is mongodb. My workplace uses sql, so it was fun to learn some nosql.
        <br>
        The app is missing a lot of features from the stories requested, i blame this on a lack of time, and poor planning with my scope.
        <br>
        I should have stuck with a very basic app, and not bothered with a framework to make requests easier on myself.
